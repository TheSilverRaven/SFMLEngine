During development of university projects (Pong, BreakOut, SpaceInvaders) using the SFML.Net binding for c# i created some tools for working with the sfml classes. Some of the features are inspired by Unity's functionality.

// TODO: will add an example / quickstart project with some instructions on how to use these tools
