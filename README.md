During development of university projects (Pong, BreakOut, SpaceInvaders) using the SFML.Net binding and c#, i created some tools for working with the sfml classes.

Also included here is a "Quickstart" Project containing the basic structure.
To use it: 
1. Open a folder in vscode
2. In a terminal: `dotnet new console`
2. followed by `dotnet add package sfml.net`
3. wait for all files to be generated (especially the bin folder can take its while :P)
4. Ctrl + Shift + P to open command pallete and run `.Net: Generate Assets for Build and Debug`
5. Now you can paste in the quickstart Program.cs and any tool scripts :>
